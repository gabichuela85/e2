## Game planning
* Create an array representing the options that the player can throw (rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock) 
* Randomly choose from this array for each of the two players, Player 1 and Player 2 
* Compare the two values 
    * If the two values are the same the game ends in a tie 
    * Otherwise evaluate each of the player's _throws_ and determine a winner 
* Keep track of the winner using a global variable 
* First player to win __2__ games will be declared the ultimate winner

## Notes for instructor
At first I attempted the war game because I do have some familiarity with PHP, but I found myself very stuck on creating the deck of cards. That is why there is a subdomain referencing a war game, and one of the pushes has comments referencing what was done on that game.

Ultimately scaling back to the expanded Rock Paper Scissors game was the better choice for me, and once I got the game running, I opted to add in the best 2 out of 3 using a while loop.
